# UX Design
  My goal for creating this app was to create a social platform only for the creativity that lives in all of us. I have found out that using the React library and its implemented feature has helped to improve the user experience more then I originally thought:

  - Allow users to be able to learn, experince and inspire others to make their own projects.
  - Helping the user to avoid refreshing the page all the time.
  - Quick responce form the website to the user.
  - Creating a space where a user can comment, like and keep up on new events that keeps their creativity going.

This site was created respecting the Five Planes of website design:

## Strategy

  __Typical User__

  *Site User*

  A typical site user would be any soul that has any kind of creativity inside them. All ages that want to either share thei own ideas, reading other peoples tips, fact or ideas.

  __User Stories__

  All the user stories where managed in the Kanban board which was created inside GitHub Projects. User stories were then prioritized with the MoSCoW approach and the labels on the Kanban board where used to manage this. The Kanban board was split into three columns to manage the various stages of development:

  1. To do: This item hasn't been started yet.
  2. In Progress: This item is actively being worked on in the Backend and Frontend.
  3. Done: All tasks have been completed.

## Scope
  
  An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach was taken to the development of this site. The main features deemed as basic requirements for this site were:

  - Account Registration
  - CRUD Functionality (For logged in users)
  - Device Responsiveness

  For a more detailed explanation of all existing features see [Existing Features](#existing-features). [Future Features](#future-features) were still within the possible scope of this project, they were not necessary at this point in time for the site to still work.

## Agile Methodology

  An Agile approach was taken for the management of this project.

  - User stories were written for each features on the side.

  - The user stories were then managed in a Kanban board, which was created inside the GitHub Projects.
